# Substitution-driven Measures of Association (SDMAs) for extracting collocations

SDMAs can be used as an alternative to measures such as PMI and Chi-squared in order to identify collocations 
in a corpus of text. For more detailed description of these measures see [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/meghdadFar/SDMA/blob/master/notebook/sdma.ipynb).

Unlike PMI and other statistical tests that are purely statistical, SDMAs take into account the semantics of
phrases and measure the collocational strength of a compound based on [Non-Substitutability test](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C10-1014).   


## Applications

Similar to PMI, SDMAs can be used to identify collocations or multiword expressions.
