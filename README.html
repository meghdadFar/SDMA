      <p>
      Association Measures (AMs) are used to identify some form of association between the components of a Multiword Expressions (MWEs) by testing whether or not they co-occur more than expected by chance. If the statistical test concludes that the components co-occur more than expected than chance, the word combination is identified as a MWE.
      Usually, further syntactic or semantic analysis takes place to refine the results either prior to measuring the associations or afterward. However, the association that is measured via AMs can be misleading at several levels.
      Take Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) that is one of the most commonly used AMs in MWE research as an example.
      It is notoriously prone to error when the co-occurring words in a word pair have a low frequency. This allows such pairs to have a high PMI.
        For instance, in a Wikipedia dump, after filtering noise, when we rank the word pairs with respect to their PMI values, the top of the ranked list is inundated by wrongly spelled word combinations such as <i>slitley redesignd</i>, and rare and unknown (to the author of this article and to Google) combinations such as <i>totimus hopula</i>.
      On the other hand, as the size of the corpus grows, rare word pairs increasingly have larger PMI values (even if their components are frequent causing the denominator of PMI to grow).
      For instance, the wrong compound <i>vehicle wash</i> that occurs only <code>7</code> times in our corpus has a PMI value of <code>4</code> meaning that it is <code>16</code> times more probable than chance.
      The components of this word pair are much more frequent than the pair itself (<i>vehicle</i>: <code>~75000</code> and <i>wash</i> <code>~7700</code>.
      Nevertheless, due to the way PMI is formulated, the large size of the corpus works in favor of these rare compounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, AMs being blind about semantics and syntax and in general linguistic properties of the word combinations, they can produce confusing results making the ranking of word combinations with respect to their statistical idiosyncrasy very difficult.
        For instance, <i>day care</i> - a semi-fixed expression, with high degrees of statistical idiosyncrasy (listed as a lexical entry in Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries), occurred <code>1609</code> times in our corpus.
        Its components i.e. <i>day</i> and <i>care</i> occurred with the frequency of <code>644606</code> and <code>127444</code>, respectively, leading to the PMI value of <code>4.6</code> for <i>day care</i> which is relatively close to the PMI value of a presumably wrong compound i.e. <i>vehicle wash</i>.
        Other examples with a PMI value that is low relative to their lexical rigidity include  <i>cover letter</i>, <code>3.7</code>; <i>food court</i>, <code>5.3</code>;
        and <i>case study</i>, <code>5.3</code> (<i>c.f.</i> the fully compositional and not lexical compound <i>cellar door</i> with a PMI value of <code>9.5</code>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of the problems associated with AMs emerge because these measures generally ignore the linguistic and semantic properties of MWEs. A practical solution is to integrate non-substitutability information into the measurement of statistical association. In the previous section, we provided two models for identifying non-substitutability. In this section, we propose a number of measures that are inspired by both non-substitutability and AMs.
        The goal is to minimize the effects of out-domain usage of the components of a MWE on its association score.
        Take <i>case study</i> as an example.
        The frequency of observing <i>study</i> (as well as observing <i>case</i>) in word combinations irrelevant to <i>case study</i> diminishes the PMI value for <i>case study</i>. However, this compound must receive a high score and subsequently be ranked highly by an ideal measure because it is the conventional way of referring to this concept. No matter how frequent <i>feasibility study</i> and other combinations that incorporate its components are, <i>case study</i> should still have a high score.
        The goal of proposing the Substitution-driven Measures of Association (SDMAs) is to eliminate this effect.
        What effects these models is when one word co-occurs frequently with one of the synonyms of the other word which leads to another plausible compound that refers to the same concept. Referring back to the previous example, only if <i>study</i> co-occurs frequently with a synonym of <i>case</i> e.g. <i>instance</i> this frequent co-occurrence effects the SDMA score of <i>case study</i>, otherwise,
        if it co-occurs frequently with other words that have nothing to do with <i>case</i>, this frequent co-occurrence does not effect the SDMA score of <i>case study</i>.
        In this case, however, since  <i>instance study</i> is very rare, its effect on the score of <i>case study</i> is negligible.
        This causes <i>case study</i> to be ranked higher than it is ranked by most AMs.
        On the other hand, word combinations such as <i>film director</i> and <i>floor space</i> will receive a lower rank (compared to the ranking produced by PMI and most other AMs) because they have frequent substitutes such <i>movie director</i> and <i>floor area</i>.
        This is also very intuitive. For instance, in \dsfar{}, while four out of four human experts annotate <i>case study</i> as markedly conventionalized (or statistically idiosyncratic), none of them consider <i>film director</i> as such.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another category of non-substitutable word combinations that need to be discussed are those combinations that are non-substitutable simply because they do not have a perceivable substitute, as in <i>ankle injury</i>. <i>Ankle</i> does not have a near synonym and the closest synonym of <i>injury</i> is <i>wound</i> leading to <i>ankle wound</i> which is a rather different concept.
        Although, to some, this compound sounds like an idiosyncratic word combination and needs to be lexicalized, the lexicographers of Merriam-Webster, Oxford and Macmillan dictionaries did not believe so, so didn't the majority of the linguists that the author consulted during the development of this work. Other such instances that contribute to the ambiguity of MWEs are <i>car keys</i> and <i>room keys</i> with PMI values of <code>6</code> and <code>2</code>, respectively.
        While none of these two are lexicalized in any of the mentioned dictionaries, \dssch annotate <i>room key</i> as idiosyncratic and <i>car key/s</i> as non-idiosyncratic. There is vey little evidence to support such classification.
        The majority of such borderline compounds fall in the middle of the spectrum of idiosyncrasy.
        Therefore, as discussed earlier, a practical approach to take toward these word combinations is again the continuum approach and focusing on the idiosyncratic end while disregarding the area in the middle.

        In the following, we explain the details of SDMAs focusing on noun compounds, however, they can be used to measure the substitution-driven association between any two words.
        Let us first define the probability of alternative for a compound in three different ways which we refer to as \( p_{a_1}(w_1w_2), p_{a_2}(w_1w_2)$, p_{a_3}(w_1w_2)\).

        $$ p_{a_1}(w_1w_2) =\sum\limits_{w'_1 \in \ S_{w_1}} \frac{C(w'_1w_2)+1 }{N+\gamma}$$

      </p>
      <p>
        Where \( S_{w_1} = A_k(w_1, \mathcal{W})\), \( N \) is the number of all word pairs in the corpus, and $C(w)$ is the number of times that $w$ appeared in the corpus.
        $\gamma$ in the denominator and the addition by one in the numerator represent a Laplace smoothing with the parameter $1$.
        In simple terms, \( p_{a_1}(w_1w_2)\) is the sum of the probabilities of those bigrams that can semantically substitute \( w_1w_2\).
        \( p_{a_1} \) assumes that the candidate substitutes for the word pair \( w_1w_2\) can be created by substituting \( w_1\).
        For instance for <i>weather forecast</i>, the substitutes according to \( p_{a_1}\) are <i>climate forecast</i>, <i>meteorology forecast</i>, etc.
        Analogously, \( p_{a_2}\) assumes that the candidate substitutes can be created by substituting \( w_2\), as in <i>weather prediction</i>.

        $$ p_{a_2}(w_1w_2) =\sum\limits_{w'_2 \in S_{w_2}} \frac{C(w_1w'_2)+1 }{N+\gamma}$$


        Meanwhile, \( p_{a_3}\) assumes that the candidate substitutes can be created by substituting both \( w_1\) and \( w_2\), as in <i>climate prediction</i>.

        $$ p_{a_3}(w_1w_2) =\sum\limits_{w'_1 \in S_{w_1}} \sum\limits_{w'_2 \in S_{w_2}} \frac{C(w_1',w'_2)+1 }{N+\gamma}$$

        Intuitively, \( p_{a_{1-3}}(w_1w_2)\) are defined as the sum of the probabilities of those bigrams that can semantically substitute \( w_1w_2\). For a \( w_1w_2\) such as <i>weather forecast</i>,
        substitution is defined as substitution of \( w_1\) (e.g., <i>climate forecast</i>) by \( p_{a_1}\), substitution of \( w_2 \) (e.g., <i>weather prediction</i>) by \( p_{a_2}\), and substitution of both
        (e.g., <i>climate prediction</i>) by \( p_{a_3}\).

      </p>

      <p>

        Subsequently, SDMAs (\( SDMA_{1-3}\))
        can be defined as measures that identify the kind of idiosyncrasy that is associated with non-substitutability.

        $$ SDMA_1(w_1w_2) = \log \frac{p(w_1w_2)}{p_{a_1}(w_1w_2)}$$

        \( SDMA_1\), in simple terms, is equal to the log of the joint probability of a word pair reduced by a factor of another probability:
        the probability of alternative pairs, assuming that the probability of alternatives is defined by \( p_{a_1}\).
        The next two measures, i.e., \( SDMA_2\) and \( SDMA_3\) are defined in the same way but they assume that the probability of alternatives is generated by \( p_{a_2}\) and \( p_{a_3}\), respectively.



        $$ SDMA_2(w_1w_2) = \log \frac{p(w_1w_2)}{p_{a_2}(w_1w_2)}$$


        $$ SDMA_3(w_1w_2) = \log \frac{p(w_1w_2)}{p_{a_3}(w_1w_2)}$$


        An obvious advantage of modeling non-substitutability in this fashion is its simplicity compared to
        the log-linear model that requires a time-consuming parameter estimation process.
        Other advantages include the ease of comparison with AMs, and better interpretability.
